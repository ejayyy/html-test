                Giveaway. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned to an email address by an

                may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. If a dispute cannot be resolved to
                Sponsor’s satisfaction, the potential winner may be deemed ineligible. Proof of submitting an Entry will

            <p>The use of any agencies or automated software, to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that
                person. Any attempt by an Entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using
                multiple/different identities, and/or any other methods will void that Entrant’s entry and that Entrant
                may

                Sponsor will not confirm receipt of entries for Entrants. All entries submitted become the sole property
                of
                Sponsor and will not be returned. </p>

            <p><b>SELECTION, NOTIFICATION, AND VERIFICATION OF WINNER: </b></p>
            <p>For Periodic Giveaways, eligible Instagram Entries in response to a Periodic Giveaway Post will form one
                pool of Entries, eligible Twitter Entries in response to a Periodic Giveaway Post will form one pool of
                Entries, and eligible Facebook Entries in response to a Periodic Giveaway Post will form one pool of
                Entries,
                for a total of three pools of Entries for each platform’s Periodic Giveaway. One potential winner will
                be
                selected, at random, by Sponsor from each pool of Entries. The drawings will occur following the
                expiration of each Response Period relating to a Periodic Giveaway. Odds of winning will depend on the
                number of valid Entries received. Entries will not be acknowledged or returned. </p>
            <p>The potential prize winners will be notified via Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook direct message, as
                applicable, with directions to claim their prize. If a potential winner does not respond on or before
                the 7th
                day following the initial notification attempt, he or she may be disqualified, and an alternate winner
                selected. Sponsor may or may not update the initial published list of the potential winner. Entries are
                subject to verification by Sponsor. Sponsor reserves the right to select or disqualify any entries as it
                deems
                appropriate, at its sole discretion. Sponsor’s decisions are final on all matters relating to this
                Giveaway. </p>
            <p>The potential winner will be required to provide to Sponsor a valid email address and physical mailing
                address (not a P.O. Box) within the time stated in the notification. Potential winner may, at Sponsor’s
                discretion, also be required to complete and return to Sponsor a notarized Affidavit of
                Eligibility/Release
                of Liability, and, if legally permissible, a Publicity Release. If required, a tax form 1099 will be
                issued to
                winner. If a potential winner fails to respond to any notification attempt within the time period
                specified by
                Sponsor, or if any attempted notification or prize delivery is returned as undeliverable, or if a
                potential
                winner fails to complete and return any required affidavit or release within the specified time period,
                or
                unable to accept the prize as stated, the potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner
                selected
                by Sponsor in its sole discretion in his/her place from among the remaining eligible Entries received.
                In the
                event a potential winner is disqualified or not eligible, Sponsor may select up to one additional
                potential
                winner.</p>
