            <p>ENTRIES ARE THE VIEWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTRANT AND DO NOT NECESSARILY
                    REFLECT THE VIEWS OF SPONSOR. SPONSOR DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN
                    CONJUNCTION WITH SAME, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR MODERATING, MONITORING OR
                    FILTERING INSTAGRAM ENTRIES. As such, entrant may be held personally liable for an Instagram
                    comment if it is defamatory, libelous or otherwise violates the rights of any person or entity</p>
            <p>In the event of a dispute as to an entrant’s Entry, the natural person who is the authorized account holder of
                    the Instagram account or email address, as applicable, associated with the selected Entry will be deemed to
                    be the entrant, but only if that person is otherwise eligible to enter the Giveaway. The “authorized account
                    holder” is the natural person assigned to an email address by an Internet access provider, online service
                    provider, Internet service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the
                    domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential winner may be required to show proof of
                    being the authorized account holder. If a dispute cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the potential
                    winner may be deemed ineligible. Proof of submitting an Entry will not be deemed by the Sponsor as proof
                    of Entry into this Giveaway. Once completed and submitted, no approval of the applicant as a participant
                    in the Giveaway, and no redemption of the applied-for product is necessary to be entered into or to win the
                    Giveaway.</p>
            <p>The use of any agencies or automated software, to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that
                    person. Any attempt by an Entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using
                    multiple/different identities, and/or any other methods will void that Entrant’s entry and that Entrant may
                    be disqualified from the Giveaway. No mechanically or programmatically reproduced entries are permitted.
                    Sponsor will not confirm receipt of entries for Entrants. All entries submitted become the sole property of
                    Sponsor and will not be returned. </p>

                    computer, online, telephone, cable, satellite, technical or mechanical malfunctions, viruses, worms, or

                    transcription of entry information; (b) undelivered, late, lost, stolen, damaged, garbled, mutilated, illegible,
                    incomplete, invalid, void, unintelligible or misdirected entries, which will be disqualified; (c) errors, typos,

                    in compliance with these Official Rules, or (e) any condition caused by events beyond the control of
                    Sponsor that may cause the promotion to be disrupted or corrupted. </p>
