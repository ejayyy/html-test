            <ul>
                <li>Visiting www.cyrillcase.com</li>
                <li>Emailing us at support@cyrillcase.com</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
                minor child.</p>
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
                period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                    collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                    respond to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a
                verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider
                requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to
                personal information associated with that specific account. We will use only personal information
                provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the
                request.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Response Timing and Format</span><br>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable
                consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
                will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will
                deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our
                written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
            <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                request’s receipt. The response we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
                consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with
                a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your
                personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one
                entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
                verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine
                that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
                estimate before completing your request.</p>

            <b>NON-DISCRIMINATION</b>

                CCPA, we will not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or service;</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or
                    other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
                    quality of goods or services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different
                prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate
                to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material
                aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you
                may revoke at any time.</p>
