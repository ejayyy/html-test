                    “Giveaway Post” is the Giveaway-related Instagram post posted by @caseology announcing this
                    Giveaway). Entrant’s completion of all three steps conforming to this Section and these Official
                    Rules will be one “Entry.” All Entry information shall be referred to herein as the “Entries” or
                    each as an “Entry.”</p>
                <p>There is no charge to sign up for Instagram. If you do not have an Instagram account, follow the
                    online instructions to register for a free Instagram account at www.instagram.com. To become a

                <p>Entries to the Giveaway are limited to one (1) entry per individual during the Giveaway Period
                    regardless of the number of Instagram accounts or email addresses a person holds. An Entrant may
                    only enter once by completing each of the three steps outlined in this Section. The use of any
                    agencies or automated software to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that person. Any
                    attempt by an Entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple/different

                    disqualified from the Giveaway. In the event of a dispute as to an entrant’s entry, the natural
                    person who is the authorized account holder of the Instagram account or email address, as
                    applicable, will be deemed to be the entrant, but only if that person is otherwise eligible to enter
                    the Giveaway. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned to a particular handle
                    by Instagram or to an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider,
                    Internet service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the
                    domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential winner may be required to show proof of
                    being the authorized account holder. If a dispute cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the
                    winning entrant may be deemed ineligible. Proof of submitting an Entry will not be deemed by the
                    Sponsor as proof of Entry into this Giveaway. No mechanically or programmatically reproduced entries
                    are permitted. Sponsor will not confirm receipt of entries for Entrants. All entries submitted
                    become the sole property of Sponsor and will not be returned.

                    with these Official Rules, or (e) any condition caused by events beyond the control of Sponsor that

                    one (1) potential prize winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received during the
                    Giveaway Period by a Sponsor representative, whose decisions are based upon their sole discretion
                    and interpretation with respect to the Giveaway, including the interpretation of these Official
                    Rules, and are final and binding in all respects. Entries are subject to verification by Sponsor.
                    The potential prize winner will be notified via email or Instagram direct message. Sponsor reserves
                    the right to select or disqualify any entries as it deems appropriate, at its sole discretion.
                    Sponsor’s decisions are final on all matters relating to this Giveaway. If a potential prize winner
                    does not respond to the email or Instagram direct message notification within 72 hours of the
                    initial attempt, such non-response will result in forfeiture of prize and selection of an alternate
                    winner.
                </p>
                <p>The winner is subject to verification. The potential winner will be required to provide to Sponsor a

                    to Sponsor a notarized Affidavit of Eligibility/Release of Liability, and, if legally permissible, a
                    Publicity Release. If a potential winner fails to respond to any notification attempt within the
                    time period specified by Sponsor, or if any attempted notification or prize delivery is returned as
                    undeliverable, or if a potential winner fails to complete and return any required affidavit or
                    release within the specified time period, or unable to accept the prize as stated, the potential
                    winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner selected by Sponsor in its sole discretion in
                    his/her place from among the remaining eligible Entries received. In the event a potential winner is
                    disqualified or not eligible, Sponsor will select up to one additional potential winner.
